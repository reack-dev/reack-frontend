# reack-frontend

The ReAck frontend is for the end user who generates an endpoint and has webhooks sent to the endpoint.

The frontend displays incoming webhooks as they are received, in real time with the help of WebSockets and the two services in the ReAck repository, the User Service and the 3rd-party Api Service. 

Built with React and TailwindCSS.
